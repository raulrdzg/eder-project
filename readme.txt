+++ SET UP AND USE +++

We first registered for a developer account on the PayPal Developer website in order to configure PayPal's API for my website.
We created a new app from the Dashboard under "My Apps & Credentials," gave it a name, and selected either production or sandbox as the environment.
In order to link our website to PayPal, this setup gave us a Client ID and a Secret.

We created a product for our business and then defined a plan with information like monthly payment, pricing, and currency because our service offers
a monthly subscription. We could have included a free trial as well. Every plan creates a distinct plan ID, which we use to activate subscriptions on
our website.

We used the link https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&vault=true&intent=subscription to add the PayPal JavaScript SDK to the header
of our HTML page for integration, replacing "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" with our real Client ID. This enables us to add buttons for payments and subscriptions 
to our website.
